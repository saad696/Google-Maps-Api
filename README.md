# Google-Maps-Api
To check it out - https://saad696.github.io/Google-Maps-Api/dist

This project is based on google maps api 
actually this is incomple and the api key is for only development mode which restrict much of its features. 
In order to get the proper key we need to create a billing account in google cloud platform to use google maps api to fullest, due to some reasons my card isn't acceptable for billing account
I'll complete it once ill resolve that issue.
this project now just have 3 features which is:
1. get the user's cuurent location automatically(which works)
2. gets the user's location when the user enters the address manually (which does'nt works)
3. generates a shraeable link of your location (which doen't works)

to make the last two feature work you can create a billing account on google cloud platform and get the api key from google maps and replace the key with my key in code.
and uncomment all the code which I've commented.
ill complete it soon!

to check out or run the project you can run the index.html file which is not in any folder [not the one in dist folder]
